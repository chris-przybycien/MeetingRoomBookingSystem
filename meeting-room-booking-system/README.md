# Meeting Room Booking System

Comments:
If I were to have two days to build this application I would firstly style this so it were much more visually appealing. I would also add a selection for multiple booking rooms as well as a full weeks schedule. I would also try and split out the buttons into reusable atoms, utilize a config file and implement a consts file so that strings arent hard coded.
I would also create and integrate a restful API using either .net 5 or .net core to handle the booking actions. I would store the data in a relational database so that the booking data could be queried and saved to avoid storing the data within the web application.

I tried my best to get the unit tests written, however React unit testing is not my strongest skill. I used React due to the fact that it is designed for this type of application and the ease of getting the app up and running. Normally I would create a solution in .Net MVC, but I didnt think that it would have been the best choice.

Application Overview:
This application allows you to select a single booking slot, or a range of adjacent booking slots. Once the slots are selected, you can confirm your booking and then this booking goes into a list of your booked time slots.
These booked time slots can then be returned if required so that those slots are available for booking again.

Running the application:
The default details are as below, but this is the summarized version.
Checkout the git repo.
Navigate to the repo's base folder
run 'npm install' to install dependencies
run 'npm start' to run the application
run 'npm test' to run unit tests

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
